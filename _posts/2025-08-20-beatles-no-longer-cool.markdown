READINGâ€”"Yeah, I mean, I just listened to Hey Jude on the radio and thought it was sooo mid", exclaimed 18 year old Paul Harrison to Allegedly News this morning. The Beatles used to be considered the greatest and most influential band of all time, but thanks to this striking and ground-breaking revelation, the narrative has shifted. The Fab Four are now being compared to artists of a more similar calibre, like Will Smith, KSI and Benson Boone. Harrison hits back at potential critics of his opinion: "Guys will say that I haven't listened to The Beatles, but that just isn't true man.  I think I heard Let It Be and Yesterday a while back, and I thought they were sooo mid."
