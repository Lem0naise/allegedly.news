WASHINGTON D.C.â€”In a rare display of bipartisan unity that shocked precisely zero constituents, Congress today passed a groundbreaking new resolution aimed at tackling the nation's burgeoning financial woes: they've simply agreed to stop looking at them. Heralded as "The Fiscal Aversion Act of 2025," the legislation establishes a state-of-the-art "National Balance Sheet Blind Spot" program, designed to help lawmakers maintain productive legislative workflows without the pesky distraction of ever-increasing deficits.

Under the new system, all government financial data, from the national debt to departmental spending, will be automatically routed to a secure, unmonitored server located deep within a decommissioned salt mine. A specialized AI, aptly named "Ostrich-GPT," will then process this information and generate weekly reports composed entirely of inspirational quotes and pictures of puppies.

"For too long, the incessant clanging of fiscal alarms has drowned out the vital work of our elected officials," stated House Speaker Rep. Brenda "The Budget Whisperer" Rodriguez (D-CA), wiping a tear from her eye with a freshly printed, unaudited dollar bill. "This historic bill frees us to focus on what truly matters: bickering over trivial amendments and ensuring our campaign donors feel adequately heard."

Minority Leader Senator Mitch "The Fiscal Foghorn" Harrison (R-KY) echoed the sentiment, albeit with his usual gravitas. "This isn't about ignoring the problem; it's about optimizing our emotional resilience to the problem," he declared, adjusting his monocle. "By strategically avoiding numerical input, we can approach our legislative duties with clear minds, unburdened by reality."

Economists, who historically rely on things like "numbers" and "reality," expressed a mix of confusion and existential dread. Dr. Evelyn Finch, head of the Institute for Applied Fiscal Collapse, commented, "While certainly novel, this approach is typically reserved for toddlers playing hide-and-seek with their vegetables. I anticipate a surge in demand for 'magic money trees' and 'infinite coupon' initiatives."

The bill, which passed with overwhelming support, also includes provisions for a new "Fiscal Wellness Retreat" in the Maldives, where lawmakers can meditate on the concept of prosperity without any harsh, quantifiable metrics. Critics, mostly comprising people who understand basic arithmetic, warned that this might not be a sustainable long-term strategy. But as one anonymous congressional aide put it, "Who cares about long-term? We just secured another term!"
