PARIS — In a landmark case that's got the salons of France buzzing like a hive of overcaffeinated bees, ten defendants are finally facing the music for their audacious online escapades: harassing Brigitte Macron with wild tales about her gender and sexuality. The charges? Sexist cyber-bullying, which prosecutors describe as "a digital drag show gone horribly wrong."

The trial kicked off Monday in a courtroom packed with lawyers, journalists, and at least one confused tourist who thought it was a fashion week recap. The accused, a motley crew ranging from basement-dwelling trolls to what one expert called "pensioners with too much time and Wi-Fi," stand accused of spreading unsubstantiated rumors that the French First Lady is secretly a man named Jean-Michel, or perhaps a time-traveling android from the 1950s. "It's not just lies," thundered the lead prosecutor, adjusting his impeccably tied Hermès. "It's lies that clash with her Louboutins."

Witness testimonies have been a riot. One defendant, a 42-year-old IT consultant from Lyon, claimed his posts were "pure satire," inspired by a late-night Wikipedia binge on ancient Roman emperors. "I mean, who hasn't wondered if powerful women are actually undercover dudes?" he shrugged, earning glares from the bench. Another, a self-proclaimed "truth warrior" with a blog called ConspiracyCroissant.com, argued that his memes were protected free speech. "In America, they'd call this investigative journalism," he insisted, before the judge reminded him this was France, where free speech ends at the nearest patisserie.

Brigitte Macron herself hasn't testified—yet—but her absence speaks volumes. Sources close to the Élysée Palace whisper she's "flattered by the creativity, if not the taste." Emmanuel Macron, ever the supportive husband, has vowed to "stand by her, pronouns and all," while quietly beefing up the palace's meme filters.

Critics of the trial say it's a slippery slope: punish these ten, and what's next? Slapping wrists for bad Photoshop jobs on world leaders? But supporters hail it as a victory for dignity in the age of doom-scrolling. As one pundit put it, "If we can't bully the elite without evidence, what's left? Arguing about croissants?"

In the end, the real winner might be French jurisprudence, proving once again that nothing unites a nation like mocking the mockers. Verdict expected next week—or whenever the defendants stop live-tweeting their alibis.
