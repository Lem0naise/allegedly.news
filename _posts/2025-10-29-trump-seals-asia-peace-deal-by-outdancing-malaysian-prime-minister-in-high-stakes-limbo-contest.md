KUALA LUMPUR — In a bold diplomatic maneuver blending negotiation with nightlife flair, U.S. President Donald Trump today announced a sweeping "peace deal" with Malaysia, achieved through an impromptu dance-off that left regional tensions limbo-ing under his superior hip sway.

The agreement, dubbed the Trump-Malaysia Accord for Eternal Groove, promises to resolve longstanding South China Sea disputes by establishing a network of American-funded dance academies across Southeast Asia. Sources close to the talks say the breakthrough came after Trump challenged Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim to a limbo contest at a state banquet, declaring victory when Ibrahim's back gave out at the 18-inch mark.

"This is huge, folks—the best dance diplomacy ever," Trump tweeted post-event, footage of his gold-lamé-clad routine already racking up millions of views. "Anwar's a great guy, but he couldn't keep up. Now, peace in Asia, and we're talking Trump Towers with built-in dance floors. Tremendous!"

Ibrahim, gracious in defeat, hailed the pact as "a rhythmic step forward," adding that it includes U.S. commitments to import unlimited durian while exporting cheeseburgers. Critics dismissed the accord as another Trumpian sideshow, but supporters argue it's the limbo point where art meets statecraft.
