CAIRNS, AUSTRALIA — An investigation is underway after the crew of the Coral Adventurer cruise ship discovered too late that they had left an 80-year-old passenger stranded on Lizard Island, where she perished from exposure amid the Great Barrier Reef's unforgiving paradise.

The incident, which occurred during a routine "tropical escape" excursion, has prompted Coral Cruises to reframe the tragedy as a bold step in sustainable tourism. Company executives announced plans to honor the unnamed Australian woman by designating Lizard Island a "premium survival suite" option for future voyages, complete with complimentary dehydration packs and optional venomous wildlife encounters.

"We deeply regret this oversight, but let's not forget: she achieved the ultimate immersion in Australia's natural wonders," said Coral Cruises CEO Harlan Driftwood at a press conference overlooking a scale model of the reef. "While others merely snorkel, she became one with the ecosystem—eaten by it, if you will. This is eco-tourism evolved."

Family members expressed outrage, with the woman's grandson calling the response "tone-deaf as a bleached coral." Authorities, meanwhile, are probing whether the crew's post-departure bingo game contributed to the delay in headcount, as the ship sailed 50 nautical miles before alerting rescuers—who arrived four days too late.

Coral Cruises maintains the mishap underscores their commitment to "adventurous authenticity," vowing to install GPS ankle monitors on all passengers over 75, lest they too inspire the next big rebrand.
