WASHINGTON—In a move that's left constitutional scholars scratching their heads and reality TV producers salivating, former President Donald J. Trump has emphatically ruled out seeking a third term. Or at least, he's ruled out the boring parts, like actually following the 22nd Amendment or that pesky vice-presidential loophole his more creative supporters had dreamed up.

Speaking to a gaggle of reporters outside a Mar-a-Lago buffet line—where he was reportedly negotiating a trade deal with a plate of shrimp cocktail—Trump declared, "I'm not doing the VP thing. That's fake news. But who knows? The country's a disaster without me. Maybe we'll figure something out. The people want it." Ah yes, the people. Those same folks who've been begging for more Twitter rants and steak tariffs since 2020. Because nothing says "democracy" like crowdsourcing executive privilege.

Supporters, ever the optimists, erupted in cheers. One MAGA hat-wearing enthusiast told our reporters, "If the Founding Fathers wanted term limits, they would've said so in gold letters on a golf course." Indeed, Trump's inner circle has floated ideas ranging from "amending the Constitution via meme" to "just declaring it a suggestion." Legal experts, meanwhile, are busy updating their résumés, predicting a Supreme Court docket longer than one of Trump's concession speeches.

Critics, those buzzkills at places like the ACLU, warn this flirts with authoritarianism. "The man lost an election and now he's auditioning for King of America," snorted one pundit. But Trump dismissed such naysayers as "losers with law degrees," insisting his only goal is to "make America great again—again." Which, if we're being cynical, sounds an awful lot like a sequel nobody asked for.

Picture it: Trump 2028, riding in on a golden escalator, promising walls around the White House and tariffs on imported humility. The GOP, that noble band of opportunists, is already recalibrating. "Third term? Fourth? Who cares, as long as he brings the crowds," said one anonymous strategist, sipping from a red Solo cup labeled "Election Integrity."

In the end, it's classic Trump: tease the impossible, dodge the details, and leave everyone wondering if democracy's just another art of the deal. One thing's certain—term limits might cap the presidency, but they can't touch that ego. It's yuge, folks. Unprecedentedly so.
