YAOUNDE, CAMEROON — In a stunning upset that shocked absolutely no one with a pulse or a passport, Cameroon's eternal overlord Paul Biya has clinched his eighth term as president, edging out rivals in an election so transparently fraudulent it might as well have come with a "Kick Me" sign on its back. At 92, Biya isn't just the world's oldest head of state—he's the reigning champion of "Why Retire When You Can Repress?" and has now outlasted four popes, three U.S. presidents named Bush (okay, two, but who's counting?), and every single iPhone model Apple has ever dreamed up.

Election officials, many of whom were probably conceived after Biya's first victory in 1982, declared the results early Tuesday amid widespread reports of voter intimidation, ballot-stuffing, and opposition candidates mysteriously vanishing into thin air—likely to reappear as extras in a low-budget vampire flick. "The people have spoken," beamed a government spokesperson, wiping suspiciously glittery sweat from his brow. "And if they didn't, well, we helped them find their voice. In a ballot box. Locked in a basement."

Biya, who looks like he was sculpted from the same indestructible wax as Madame Tussaud's forgotten exhibits, addressed the nation from his fortified palace, promising continuity in all things: endless corruption, sporadic blackouts, and youth unemployment rates that could double as a dystopian sci-fi plot. "I will serve until Cameroon is free from the tyranny of change," he croaked, his voice echoing like a dial-up modem in a haunted library. Insiders whisper that his secret to longevity involves a daily regimen of power naps, imported French croissants, and the occasional ritual sacrifice of democratic ideals.

Critics, those pesky holdouts who haven't yet been "re-educated," decried the vote as a sham, pointing to violence that left streets littered with protest signs and the occasional tear gas canister. International observers, sipping tepid tea in air-conditioned hotels, issued the standard boilerplate: "We urge all parties to respect the process." Translation: "We're not getting involved; pass the croissants."

As Biya settles in for term number eight—projected to end around the year 2140, give or take a civil war—Cameroon braces for more of the same: a nation run by a man who's seen more coups than birthdays. In a region where leaders cling to power like barnacles on a sinking ship, Biya's victory proves one eternal truth: Democracy is messy, but dictatorship? That's forever. At this rate, he'll be handing out campaign swag to his great-great-grandkids while the rest of us debate whether he's a genius or just too stubborn to die. Spoiler: It's both.
