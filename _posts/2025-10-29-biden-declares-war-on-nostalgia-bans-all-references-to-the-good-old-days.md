WASHINGTON, D.C. — In a bold move to eradicate what he called "the root of all modern discontent," President Joe Biden signed an executive order Tuesday banning any public mention of "the good old days" effective immediately.

The sweeping legislation targets nostalgic reminiscing in speeches, social media, and casual conversation, with fines up to $5,000 for first-time offenders. "Folks, we've got to stop living in the past," Biden said from the Rose Garden, squinting at his notes. "The good old days? They weren't that good. Gas was cheap, sure, but so was discrimination. Progress means looking forward, not backward at rotary phones and leaded gasoline."

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre defended the order, stating, "This is about unity. If we all pretend the past never happened, we can focus on the future—like affordable insulin and whatever else we're doing." Historians warn the ban could rewrite textbooks overnight, while conservatives decry it as an assault on apple pie and baseball.

Enforcement will begin with AI censors scanning online posts, ensuring America marches into tomorrow without a single wistful glance behind.
