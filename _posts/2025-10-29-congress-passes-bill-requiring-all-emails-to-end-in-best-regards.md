WASHINGTON, D.C. â€” In a bipartisan effort to restore civility to digital communication, lawmakers unanimously approved the Email Etiquette Enforcement Act, mandating that every professional email conclude with the phrase "Best regards" to combat the rising tide of abrupt sign-offs.

"Threads of discourse have frayed under the weight of casual closings like 'Cheers' or worse, nothing at all," said House Speaker Mike Johnson, adjusting his tie during the signing ceremony. "This simple phrase will weave back the fabric of professional courtesy, one email at a time."

The legislation, sponsored by a coalition of etiquette experts and former BlackBerry users, imposes fines up to $500 for violations, with exemptions only for certified haiku closers. Tech giants like Microsoft have already updated Outlook to auto-append the phrase, citing "unprecedented harmony in beta testing."

Critics, however, worry about overreach. "What about 'Warmly' for close colleagues?" protested one lobbyist. "This is the beginning of the end for personalized sign-offs." Proponents dismissed the concerns, signing off with a collective "Best regards."
