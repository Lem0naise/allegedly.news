PARIS — Two suspects in the brazen Louvre jewelry heist have offered only partial confessions, admitting to pilfering the museum's lesser-known gems while insisting a shadowy consortium of elite influencers orchestrated the theft of the crown jewels.

The duo, identified as amateur gem enthusiasts Pierre LeFaux and Marie Bijou, told investigators they targeted the "bargain bin" pieces—think cubic zirconia Marie Antoinette earrings and knockoff Napoleonic tiaras—because the real haul was too "Instagram-worthy" for their modest tastes.

"These were the jewels nobody would miss," LeFaux said from custody, shrugging off charges. "The good stuff? That's for the big leagues, like some Kardashian-level cartel who probably swapped them for avocado toast vouchers."

Paris prosecutor Antoine Duval revealed the heist may involve a larger network, possibly tied to the global "Luxury Loot League," a supposed syndicate that funnels stolen artifacts into influencer hauls and NFT drops. "The unrecovered items scream sophistication," Duval said. "We're talking diamonds that could fund a small revolution—or at least a decent escargot tour."

Louvre officials, meanwhile, downplayed the loss, noting the museum's insurance covers "all valuables except those with actual historical value." Tourists continue to flock to the site, snapping selfies with empty display cases under the caption: "When the bling disappears but the vibe stays iconic."
