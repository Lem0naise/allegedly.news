X-Ville, CA — In a move that has been hailed as "bold," "innovative," and "the most cost-effective rebrand in corporate history," X owner Elon Musk has unveiled the platform's latest feature: the return of the iconic Twitter bird logo, only it’s been flipped completely upside down.

The rebrand, codenamed "Project What-The-Fuck-Do-We-Do-Next," was announced via a cryptic post on the platform itself. The post, which simply contained the phrase "pɹᴉq ǝɥʇ ɟo uɹnʇǝɹ ǝɥʇ", sent waves of confusion through the user base.

“It's a really layered metaphor,” explained one anonymous source from inside X's new, bird-shaped headquarters. “The bird is upside down to symbolize a new perspective, a different way of looking at things. It's a statement about the current state of social media. You wouldn't understand."

"I just thought it looked cool," Musk commented. "Also, it's different from the original Twitter logo, so like, it's my thing now. The bird is mine. I made the bird logo. When you see it you should think of me, Elon Musk."

The company's stock price has dipped by 14% in the last 24 hours, however a source from X said: "If you turn your phone upside down, like you now have to when using X, then you'll see we actually gained 14%."
