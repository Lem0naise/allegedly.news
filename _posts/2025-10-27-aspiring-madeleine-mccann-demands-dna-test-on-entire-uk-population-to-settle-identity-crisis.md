LONDON — In a courtroom drama that's equal parts identity theft thriller and budget therapy session, Julia Wandelt took the stand Monday to defend herself against charges of stalking Kate and Gerry McCann. The Polish woman, who burst onto the scene earlier this year claiming to be the long-lost Madeleine McCann—disappeared in 2007 at age three—insisted she's still wracked by existential doubt. "I question who I am every day," she told the judge, her eyes darting around as if expecting a missing persons poster to float in like a bad hallucination. "Maybe I'm Madeleine. Maybe I'm just really bad at remembering birthdays."

Wandelt's saga began when she posted eerie online pleas for the McCanns to "recognize" her, complete with side-by-side photos that looked about as convincing as a cat pretending to be a dog. The McCanns, who've spent nearly two decades chasing real leads on their daughter's vanishing, responded with a polite but firm "No, thanks" via solicitors. Undeterred, Wandelt showed up at their events, reportedly whispering, "Mom? Dad? Remember that time in Portugal?" to bewildered attendees. Stalking charges followed, because nothing says "family reunion" like a restraining order.

Experts are baffled, but not surprised. "This is peak 21st-century delusion," said psychologist Dr. Eliza Thorne, sipping coffee that probably cost more than Wandelt's legal fees. "Social media turns every midlife crisis into a missing child hoax. Next, she'll claim to be Elvis, demanding peanut butter and banana sandwiches from Graceland." Wandelt's defense? A tearful testimony about "gut feelings" and a childhood scar that "totally matches" Madeleine's—though it turned out to be from a kitchen accident involving a potato peeler.

The McCanns, ever the picture of dignified restraint, issued a statement wishing Wandelt well but emphasizing that their daughter remains missing. "We're flattered by the interest," it read, "but please stop showing up at our door with crayons and a passport application." As for Wandelt, she's vowing to appeal if convicted, hinting at crowdfunding for a nationwide DNA sweep. "If I'm not Madeleine, who is? The lot of you owe me answers!"

In a twist that even M. Night Shyamalan couldn't script, Wandelt admitted under cross-examination that her real name might be Julia, but "spirits told me otherwise." The judge, fighting a smirk, adjourned for lunch. Britain's tabloids are already printing T-shirts: "I Survived My Own Kidnapping—Did You?"

This case raises thorny questions about identity in the age of deepfakes and dopamine hits. Is Wandelt a tragic figure lost in her own narrative, or just the latest grifter chasing viral fame? Either way, one thing's clear: If she *is* Madeleine, the McCanns might want to invest in better locks. Or perhaps a family therapist who specializes in plot twists.
