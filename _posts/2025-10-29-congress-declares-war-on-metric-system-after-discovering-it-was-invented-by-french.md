WASHINGTON, D.C. â€” In a bold stand against foreign influence, lawmakers have unanimously voted to declare the metric system an enemy combatant, citing its origins in revolutionary France as a clear and present threat to American exceptionalism.

"There are 231.4 cubic inches in a gallon, and that's the Lord's own measurement," thundered Sen. Buck Thunderbumper during the debate. "This commie decimal nonsense is nothing but a Trojan horse for baguettes and berets."

The resolution calls for all rulers, scales, and soda bottles to be retrofitted with imperial units within 90 days, or face immediate deportation to Canada. NASA has been tasked with bombing any remaining Centigrade thermometers into obsolescence.

Critics, mostly engineers under 50, warned of chaos in construction and baking, but proponents dismissed their concerns: "Real patriots don't need decimals; they use good old gut instinct and a dash of freedom."
