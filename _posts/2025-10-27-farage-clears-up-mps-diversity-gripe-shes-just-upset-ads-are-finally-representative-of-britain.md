LONDON—In a bold stand against the creeping menace of inclusive advertising, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has rushed to the defense of MP Sarah Pochin, insisting her complaint about TV spots being "full" of black and Asian people was "ugly in wording, perhaps, but pure patriotism at heart."

Pochin, fresh off issuing a half-hearted apology for her viral rant, had taken to social media to lament the apparent shortage of pale-faced Brits in everything from car insurance ads to detergent pitches. "It's like they've forgotten who shops here," she fumed, before deleting the post faster than a diversity consultant at a Reform rally.

Farage, never one to miss a chance to polish a turd, held an emergency presser outside a kebab shop—purely for optics, he assured reporters. "Look, Sarah's not racist; she's just channeling the quiet desperation of every white bloke who's ever flipped past a commercial and thought, 'Where's my people?'" he declared, pausing to eye a passing halal butcher with suspicion. "This isn't hate—it's market research! If ads featured more ruddy-cheeked farmers yelling about Brexit, sales would skyrocket."

Critics, predictably, were less charitable. Labour's shadowy diversity enforcers labeled it "tone-deaf dog-whistling," while online hordes unearthed Pochin's old tweets praising a "traditional" England of rain, tea, and unspoken resentments. One viral meme photoshopped her face onto the Monopoly man, captioning it: "Do not pass Go, do not collect £200 in reparations."

Undeterred, Farage floated a radical solution: mandatory "balance quotas" for ads, ensuring at least 75% of smiling families are inexplicably ginger and complaining about immigrants. "We'll make Britain great again—one pale face at a time," he vowed, before heading off to film a cameo in a Hunt's ketchup spot as the beleaguered everyman.

Pochin, meanwhile, has retreated to her constituency office, where she's reportedly brainstorming a petition for "Bring Back the White Bread Guy." Sources close to her say she's considering therapy—or at least a thesaurus for her next outburst. In a nation weary of scandals, this one's proving refreshingly low-stakes: no sex tapes, no embezzlement, just good old-fashioned discomfort with progress.

As ad execs scramble to diversify further out of spite, one thing's clear—Reform UK's got the pulse of the pub crowd. Or is it the rant? Either way, tune in next week for Farage on why emojis need more Union Jacks.
