NEW DELHI — In a dazzling display of digital ingenuity gone awry, homemade "carbide guns" – essentially firecracker pistols cobbled from calcium carbide and soda bottles – exploded from TikTok tutorials to a nationwide hazard just in time for Diwali, leaving over 50 children temporarily blinded by the festival's newfound flash mob appeal.

What began as innocent social media stunts, with influencers demonstrating how to blast mini-rockets for that perfect slow-mo glow-up, quickly escalated into backyard battlegrounds. "We wanted to light up the feeds and the skies," said viral sensation @DiwaliDynamite, a 22-year-old content creator from Uttar Pradesh, whose tutorial racked up 10 million views. "Who knew enlightenment could be so... eye-opening? Next year, we're pivoting to sparklers – safer for the retinas, still slays on Reels."

Health officials report a spike in corneal burns from the DIY devices, which mimic gunfire with startling bursts of flame. The irony isn't lost on festival purists: Diwali, the Hindu celebration of light over darkness, now features tutorials promising "Diwali glow-ups" that plunge young users into actual darkness. Authorities have issued warnings, but enforcement lags behind the latest algorithm-fueled trends.

One pediatric ophthalmologist, speaking anonymously, quipped, "Social media's turning our kids into fireworks prodigies, but at this rate, we'll need braille captions for the next viral challenge." As Diwali cleanup continues, experts urge parents to prioritize diyas over downloads – lest the festival of lights become the season of sightless selfies.
