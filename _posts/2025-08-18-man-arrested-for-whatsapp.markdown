WOKING—In a decisive move to finally regulate the nation's mood, a 42-year-old man has been fined £800 in the first major prosecution under the Online Safety Act's broad powers to prevent "emotional harm."

The man, David Thorpe, was found guilty of knowingly deploying a passive-aggressive statement in a Neighbourhood Watch WhatsApp group. The offending message, "Fine. If that's what everyone wants to do, I guess I'll come along," was deemed by Ofam regulators to be a "significant source of negative online sentiment."
