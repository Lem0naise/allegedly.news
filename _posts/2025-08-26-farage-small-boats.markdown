CLACTON â€” The leader of Reform UK is pledging to measure every small boat arriving on British shores, in the hope this measure will help satisfy voters who are calling for reduced immigration. 

"There are simply too many small boats," Farage said at a press conference this morning. "The people don't want small boats - so, clearly, they want large boats. We all want larger boats! Britain needs larger boats."

If they come to power at the next election, Reform have promised they will establish the Office for Boat Measuring, and any boats smaller than 185cm in length or 5m in circumference will be barred from entering British waters. 

Labour has attacked the plans, saying they are "ridiculous" and that they are planning to tackle the "key issues, the girth of the boat and the material the hull is made of", issues Labour leader Keir Starmer says are much more in step with what British people are asking for.
