SAN FRANCISCOâ€”OpenAI CEO Sam Altman today announced the immediate release of the company's new flagship AI model, ChatGPT-5o-o4-3-o5-mini-large-o5-5o-mini-pro-thinking-5-pro. The new model, unveiled in a brief, 2-second pre-recorded video, is designed to be a direct and much more memorable successor to last week's less popular ChatGPT-4o-o4-3-o5-mini-large-o5-5o-mini-pro-thinking-4.

"We heard the feedback loud and clear. Our customers wanted a simple, intuitive naming system that tells them exactly what they're getting," said Altman in a blog post accompanying the release. "The '5-pro' at the end now clearly signals that this model is one better than the previous one, wjhile the thinking suffix assures our users that this version is in fact thinking. We're all about transparency here at OpenAI."

The model boasts several groundbreaking features, including a 7% increase in image yellowness, a 4% increase in syntactic vagueness and a 34% increase in bad business pitches being generated by the model. The 'large-o5' and '5o-mini' components reportedly allow the AI to be both bigger and smaller than its predecessor at the same time, a feature insiders have described as a "quantum leap".

The company is also reportedly workshopping future versions, including one with an emoji in the middle and another whose name is a non-transferable NFT containing ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics.
