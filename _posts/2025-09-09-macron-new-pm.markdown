PARIS â€” French President Emmanuel Macron has today announced the country's new Prime Minister - the reanimated corpse of former President Jacques Chirac. After PM Bayrou's resignation earlier today, Macron was forced to form his nine hundred and twelfth government of the year so far. After exhausting his supply of MPs and supporters across the country, Macron had no choice but to reanimate the corpse of the former UDR President.
