MAR-A-LAGO, FL â€“ Former President Donald J. Trump, ever the humble statesman, has magnanimously announced he will *not* be exploiting the "pedestrian" Vice Presidential loophole to secure a third term. Instead, he confirms he prefers a "much more personalized, frankly, bespoke" method of constitutional reinterpretation. This news comes as a relief to many legal scholars bracing for the tedious paperwork involved in a VP transfer.

"Look, the VP thing? It's for amateurs," Trump stated from his golf course, pausing a profound thought on divot repair. "It's small-time. Very small. They want me to sneak in like a common *vice president*. No, thank you."

Instead, sources close to the former President indicate he is exploring options including "President-for-Life by Acclamation," "A Really Good Strong Suggestion from the People," and a direct appeal to what he termed "The Spirit of the Electoral College, which is tremendous, believe me." One advisor, speaking anonymously while frantically searching for Article II, Section 1, Clause 1, admitted, "We're not entirely sure what he means by 'personalized bypass,' but it probably involves rallies and a very large, gilded key."

Constitutional expert Dr. Agnes Periwinkle of the University of Nowhere expressed her bewilderment. "The idea that the Constitution is merely a set of 'suggestions' to be 'personalized' is, shall we say, novel. It's like saying a speed limit is just a guideline for how fast you *feel* like going today." She then added, "Though, many drivers treat them that way."

When pressed for details on this "bespoke" route, Trump simply winked. "When you're this popular, you don't need loopholes. The people *are* the loophole. They want me. It's the biggest loophole of all, and it's tremendous."

The exact nature of this "people-powered constitutional adjustment" remains elusive, but political analysts agree it will be historic, unprecedented, and likely involve new lines of merchandise. The Supreme Court has reportedly assigned extra interns to "pre-emptively Google 'what happens if a president just... doesn't leave?'"
