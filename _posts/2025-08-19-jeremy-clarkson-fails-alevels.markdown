COTSWOLDSâ€”The former BBC Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson has reportedly failed his A-Levels once again this week, in a blow to his career prospects as he was hoping to enter the University of Hard Knocks this coming September. He posted his results on Twitter once again, saying: "If your A level results are disappointing, don't worry. If you're from a wealthy family like I am, you'll be just fine."
