WOKINGâ€”A British man has been sentenced to twelve years in prison under new Online Safety Act provisions this week, in a move the police say will protect the public from from similar villianous criminals.

The man, Martin Fletcher, 48, was accused of the unlicensed comparison of Brassica oleracea to the British politician Liz Truss, had after he forwarded a post from his Aunt Carol to a "Woking Dads FC" WhatsApp Group. The offending post contained vicious references to allotments and egregious images of undersized courgettes being brandished suggestively by old women.

As the government expands their operations fighting international crime, the unit is also reportedly investigating any online website which contains the colour 'Orange', a clear reference to the lynching of US President Donald Trump.
