TEXAS â€” According to recently unsealed court documents from the ex-girlfriend of disgraced former financier Jeffrey Epstein Ghislaine Maxwell, Trump was only a loosely affiliated acquaintance of the couple. In the newly uncovered testimony, she clarified: "I only met him [Trump] once", and then went on to say: ", maybe twice, three times a day, five days a week, each week of the year except when he was golfing, every year since 1992. Just an acquaintance, really."
